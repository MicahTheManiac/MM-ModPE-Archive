== Mod Information ==
Creation Date: Late 2015
Supported Versions: MCPE 0.12

== Description ==
Definitely inspired by Terra Firma Craft. Not sure if I ever released this in beta or not. I do know I wanted to allow support for other mods to use with this. The main addition is spears and the fact you could not break items without a tool. You needed fiber which I think dropped from grass.
