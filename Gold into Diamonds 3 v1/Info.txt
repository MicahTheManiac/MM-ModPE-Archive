== Description ==
Gold into Diamonds was a mod I made back for Minecraft PE 0.8.1. I forget what much of the original mod did besides turn gold into diamonds, but given Pre-0.9.0 had 256x256 worlds, it would have made some sense to convert some useless gold into diamonds. The 3rd Edition removes the "Block Grabbing Claw" and adds a new ore, which doesn't generate. No idea where I was going with that gimmick.
