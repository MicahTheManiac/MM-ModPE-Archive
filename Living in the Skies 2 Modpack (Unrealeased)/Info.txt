== Mod Information ==
Creation Date: Sometime in 2016
Supported Versions: Unsure, maybe 0.14

== Description ==
The 2nd Edition to Living in the Skies. I think this was maybe created around a year after the first Modpack. This utilizes a custom tool API, which was something too advanced for me, so thankfully someone created that. The script file contains over 1000 lines of code thanks to this API and the Core or LITS2. I ended up giving this off to someone else to develop, but I forget who and I don't think it ever got released.

== Script Comment Description ==
Living in the Skies 2 -- Develeoper Edition
