== Mod Information ==
Creation Date: Early 2016
Supported Versions: Likely MCPE 0.13 & 0.14

== Description ==
As the Script file says, this it was inspired by "The Iron Alchemist" by Jragon014. Looking back at this in 2014, I didn't know what exactly I was talking about back then, but a quick search led me to this: https://youtu.be/TBeYLbWmPqc
As far as I can tell, this is what inspired me to create a very similar mod.

== Script Comment Description ==
This Mod is based off of The Iron Alchemist command block module for the Enchanted Engines Command ModPack Project by Jragon014

This mod allows you to place 8 of any ore down and get more in return along with some EXP.
