== Description ==
Gold into Diamonds was a mod I made back for Minecraft PE 0.8.1. I forget what much of the original mod did besides turn gold into diamonds, but given Pre-0.9.0 had 256x256 worlds, it would have made some sense to convert some useless gold into diamonds. For the 2nd Edition, I decided to add blocks known as Generators that would generate these diamonds.

originalZIP.zip is the original ZIP file for the mod.
